// Package autotune keeps inbounds reachable without the admin. It moves an inbound to
// another port when devices stop reaching it while they still reach the node's other
// inbounds, i.e. the port is blocked on the way (the RU DPI does this per server and
// port), and it replaces a REALITY target that stopped working. Both are switched on in
// settings and per inbound; clients learn the change from their next subscription update.
